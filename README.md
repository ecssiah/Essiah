# Essiah

This is the original repository for the open language, Essiah.

The repo contains a few documents that explain the basics and give some examples. The basic principle was to make a simplified and phonetic English.

![Alphabet](/media/alphabet.png?raw=true)

The alphabet does not use the exact characters from English, but it is heavily inspired by the English, and it was purposefully designed to be easy to learn for someone who already knows English. The alphabet is largely produced by rotating base characters to form groupings of related characters.

Each highlighted group of letters is produced by rotating the first character in the sequence. In this way, the alphabet can partially be generated rather than memorized. 

In every case where the Essiah letter strongly resembled an English letter, that letter was chosen to represent a corresponding sound in English. So, roughly speaking, if it looks like an English letter, then it sounds like that letter in Essiah. Therefore, the character that looks like the letter, o, is always pronounced as it is in "hot" when it is short and "vote" when it is long.

The long forms of the vowels are written by doubling the vowel in the word, or by using one of the many diphthongs available. This can be seen in the name of the language itself:

The first "backwards slash" character is the letter that corresponds to the English e, it sounds like the e from "bet". The second e is doubled, and therefore is read long, as in the word "tea". 

When using the font, you can access the doubled characters by using the capitalized version of the single letter (Essiah has no capitalization). These condensed versions only exist for the a, e, and i characters, which all derive from a single line that can easily be doubled. To make a "long o" or a "long u", the letters are simply written twice.

## Tense

The distinction between past, present, and future tense is handled by prefixing or suffixing the o letter to a verb. The tenses in English are all possible with the use of markers which indicate whether an action was "continuous" or "completed", these concepts are also associated with the terms "progressive" and "perfect" in English grammar. 

The documents in this collection demonstrate the markers and how they are used with the tense system to produce all of the English tenses like Past Progressive Perfect.

## Numbers

There are no unique characters for numbers. 

The numerals 0-9 are mapped directly onto the first ten letters of the alphabet, and then the named powers of ten from English are mapped onto the remaining letters in ascending order (i.e. ten, hundred, thousand, million). 0 and 1 retain their usual form in Essiah, so the alphabet begins with the two characters that closely resemble the English numerals 0 and 1. 

Unless the context makes the number clear, they should be written after an "inverted caret", which is accessed with the keystroke that creates a semi-colon in English (Essiah has no semi-colons). This is placed right before the number to distinguish it from a word, since the numbers also act as letters. There are many cases where numbers are written in something like a spreadsheet where the inverted caret symbol can be omitted.

The names of the numbers are also derived in a systematic way from the names of these letters. This is explained with examples in the repo documents.

## Example Sentence

![Number example](/media/number-example.png)

In this example, the "inverted caret" is used. When a number is within a sentence like this, the symbol is used to avoid confusing it with a word. The verb "to stand", which is the first word of the example sentence, begins with a vowel, so instead of adding the usual 'o' character to the beginning to indicate past tense, the 'a' vowel is doubled and made long.
